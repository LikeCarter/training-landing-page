                        p(class="text-gray-600") Iris began her fitness career as a competitive soccer player throughout her entire childhood and later going on to play in college at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. While playing, she began working as an assistant coach for the Wilmington Hammerheads where she would ultimately take over as Director of the Sports Science Program. In addition to training elite soccer players, Iris also enjoyed being a fitness instructor at several wellness centers for retirement communities. Such a variety has allowed her to gain experience and confidence in modifying training around limitations, injury prevention, as well as meeting others at any fitness level.
