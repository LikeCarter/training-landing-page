                    p Last Updated: January 16, 2018 Acceptance of Terms of Service Welcome to FYT. FYT (“FYT”, “we”, or “us”) provides a personalized online fitness coaching and workout program, fitness community, and related services, content, features and products through the FYT website located at https://train.iamfyt.com (the “FYT Site” or the “Site”) and through mobile and desktop or device applications (including iOS and applications) and FYT-controlled social media pages (including on Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Twitter) (collectively, the “FYT Service” or the “Service”). By registering as a member or by visiting, browsing, or using the FYT Service in any way, you (as a “user”) accept these Terms of Service (“Agreement”), which forms a binding agreement between you and FYT. PLEASE NOTE: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER (SEE BELOW). READ CAREFULLY, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT, IF APPLICABLE, TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED BELOW, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND FYT WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-⁠WIDE ARBITRATION. If you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, do not access or use the FYT Service. Certain elements of the FYT Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified from time to time; your use of those elements of the FYT Service is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. This Site is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older, and reside in the United States or any of its territories or possessions. By using this Site, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with us and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Site. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the FYT Service to any person or entity and change the eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that this Agreement is in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, and the right to access and use the FYT Service is revoked where this Agreement or use of the FYT Service is prohibited or conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the FYT Service is offered only for your personal use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. The FYT Service Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, FYT grants you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and use the FYT Service for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.

All rights not expressly granted by FYT in this Agreement are reserved. Beta Services From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to install, use and test  (“Beta Testing”) certain of the FYT Services prior to their commercial release (the “Beta Services”).  Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use and are subject to following additional terms: (i) as part of your participation in Beta Testing, we may loan you an Apple® watch (the “Watch”) without charge. You agree that the Watch is provided as a component of and shall constitute part of the Beta Services as set forth below.  You agree to return the Watch to us at our request at any time, and if you do not return the watch or decide to purchase the Watch we may charge you the then-current market-price for such Watch; (ii) we grant you a limited right to use the Beta Services for Beta Testing purposes during the applicable testing period; (iii) you may provide suggestions, comments, or other feedback with respect to the Beta Services as reasonably requested, including ideas for modifications and enhancements (the “Beta Feedback”).  You hereby assign to us all right, title and interest in and to the Beta Feedback.  All Beta Services and your Beta Feedback are FYT’s Confidential Information, and FYT may use your Beta Feedback in advertising and promotional materials with your prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); (iv) we reserve the right to modify the Beta Services or terminate your participation in the Beta Testing for any reason, without liability to you. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable advance notice of such termination; (v) the Beta Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise. Use of the Beta Services is at your sole risk.   In no event will we be liable to you for any damage whatsoever arising out of the use of or inability to use the Beta Services; and Membership and Subscriptions To enjoy full access to the FYT Service, you must register as a member of the FYT Service and enter into a subscription agreement for access to our live and on-demand workouts, content and features (a “Subscription”). You must provide complete and accurate registration information to FYT, complete the Subscription process, and notify us if any of your information changes. You may not use someone else's name, or any name, location or other public profile information that violates any third party rights or that is offensive, obscene or otherwise objectionable (in FYT’s sole discretion). Similarly, you may not use any image that violates any third party rights or that is offensive, obscene or otherwise objectionable (in FYT’s sole discretion). You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by unauthorized users. You may not allow others to use your account. You must safeguard the confidentiality of your password, and if you are using a device that others have access to, log out of your account after using the FYT Service. If you become aware of an unauthorized access to your account, change your password and notify us immediately at contact@iamfyt.com. By purchasing a Subscription you will get full access to all of FYT’s available classes, content, and features on the FYT Service for as long as that Subscription remains active. Features and prices are subject to change. The account holder of the Subscription will be the person who activated the Subscription (the “Subscription Holder”). Account Registration You can register by creating an account on the FYT Site, as further described in our Terms of Service. All information that you provide must be accurate, including your name, address, credit, debit or charge card numbers and expiration dates, and any other payment information. You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date and must provide changes promptly to contact@iamfyt.com. FYT’s use of your information is governed by our Privacy Policy. YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD. When you first sign up for a Subscription you may be required to agree to a specific price and plan, which may include a commitment period term of one or more years (“Commitment Period”). We encourage you to maintain your Subscription for the applicable Commitment Period. The price available with your plan is valid until the Commitment Period expires, at which time your Subscription will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis at the then-existing non-promotional price for your Subscription level. FYT may offer additional promotions or discounts related to Subscriptions from time to time. Please read the details of those offers carefully, as any additional terms presented to you during the sign-up process will form part of these Purchase and Subscription Terms. Unless specified in writing, all discount offers that require a payment are non-refundable, and all free months offered are in addition to the Commitment Period. Any free trial or other promotion must be used within the specified time frame of the trial or promotion. You may be required to have a valid payment method on file in order to initiate a free trial; if you do not cancel before your free trial period ends, your account will be converted to a paid Subscription and will be charged in accordance with these Purchase and Subscription Terms. Membership Structure and Fees Your FYT Subscription recurs on a monthly basis at the then-current rate until cancelled in accordance with the terms below. Billing occurs at the beginning of the Subscription cycle and provides unlimited access for one month thereafter. If the amount to be charged varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in sales tax), we will provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. To change or terminate your Subscription, contact Member Support at contact@iamfyt.com. If you terminate your Subscription, you may use your Subscription until the end of the then-current term and your Subscription will not be renewed after the then-current term expires. For more information on cancelling your Subscription, please read the following section. Suspension/Termination by FYT. FYT may immediately terminate or suspend your account, and all or a portion of your Subscription, without notice if: (a) your payment is more than 15 days overdue; (b) you provide false or inaccurate information; (c) you violate these Purchase and Subscription Terms, the Terms of Service or any other FYT rules or agreements then in effect; (d) you engage in conduct that is a violation of any applicable law or tarrif (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property laws); or (e) if you engage in conduct that is threatening, abusive or harassing to FYT employees, agents, or other FYT users, including, for example, making threats to physically harm or damage property. If we terminate or suspend your Subscription, your license to use any software or content provided in connection with the Subscription is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Subscription is terminated, FYT has the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges through the date of termination. Should you wish to resume your Subscription after any suspension, a restoration of service fee may apply. This fee is in addition to all past due unpaid charges and other fees. Third-Party Payment Processor You agree to pay us, through our payment processor or financing partner (as applicable), all charges at the prices then in effect for any purchase in accordance with the applicable payment terms presented to you at the time of purchase. You agree to make payment using the payment method you provide when you set up your account. We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our payment processor or financing partner to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or received. Bill Inquiries and Refunds If you believe you have been billed in error for a Subscription, please notify us within 60 days of the billing date by emailing contact@iamfyt.com. FYT will not issue refunds or credits after the expiration of this 60-day period, except where required by applicable law. Sale of Products FYT accepts orders for the Apple® watch and any other equipment, apparel or accessories that we may offer through the FYT Site. Unfortunately, availability of products cannot be guaranteed. Unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase, you must pay for products when you place the order. All products ordered will be delivered to the U.S. shipping address you provide. We reserve the right to cancel an order placed by you at any time and for any lawful reason prior to our delivery of the product(s) and receipt of payment in full from you, provided that we will refund any fees that you prepaid for those products.

Dispute Resolution—Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Jury Trial PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH FYT AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. THIS SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”. Scope of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this contract, including the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or FYT may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).

CASES MAY HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY—AND OTHERS MAY BE FILED IN THE FYT—THAT ATTEMPT TO ASSERT CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, AND BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU ELECT NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CASES. IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH THE COMPANY, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR. Arbitration Rules and Forum. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, General Counsel, at 225 Bush Street, 12th Floor West, San Francisco, CA 94104. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com (under the Rules/Clauses tab) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees from JAMS, FYT will pay them for you. In addition, FYT will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Arbitrator Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and FYT. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and FYT. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND FYT WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and FYT are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions; Severability. YOU AND FYT AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor FYT is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Governing Law below, and all other provisions of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in force. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the void or unenforceable provision shall be severed and such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement. Opt Out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor FYT can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement.
